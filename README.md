Project Overview:

Introduction: A data compression tool is software designed to reduce the size of digital files or datasets, making them easier to store, transmit, and process. It works by eliminating redundant or unnecessary data while preserving essential information.

Types of Compression:
1. Lossless Compression: Retains all original data and allows perfect reconstruction. Examples include ZIP, PNG, and FLAC formats.
2. Lossy Compression: Reduces file size by discarding less important data, which may lead to quality loss. Examples include JPEG, MP3, and MP4 formats.

Key Features:
Compression Algorithms: Common algorithms include Huffman coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
Speed & Efficiency: Balances between compression ratio and processing time.
File Format Support: Handles various file types, such as text, images, audio, and video.
Encryption & Security: Some tools offer encryption to protect compressed data.
Batch Processing: Allows multiple files to be compressed at once.
Popular Data Compression Tools:
WinRAR & 7-Zip: General-purpose file compression.
Gzip & Bzip2: Common for Unix/Linux environments.
Zstandard & LZ4: High-speed compression for real-time applications.
FFmpeg: Compresses multimedia files.

Applications:
Storage Optimization: Saves disk space.
Faster Transmission: Reduces bandwidth usage for file transfers.
Backup & Archiving: Efficiently stores large amounts of data.
Streaming & Web Optimization: Enhances performance of online content.
Choosing the right compression tool depends on factors like file type, required compression ratio, and processing speed.
